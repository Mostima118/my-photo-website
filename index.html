    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Wilson, a passionate photographer with over 10 years of experience behind the lens.
      My love for photography began with a deep appreciation for the natural world, and to this day,
      I spend most of my time capturing breathtaking landscapes, wildlife, and serene moments in nature.
      Whether it’s the quiet beauty of a forest or the subtle movement of animals in their habitat,
      I strive to preserve the emotion and atmosphere of every scene I witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last few years, my interests have expanded to include aviation and automotive photography —
      fields that combine my love for speed, precision, and engineering. I find joy in capturing the
      power and elegance of aircraft in flight and the sleek lines of vehicles in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I'm excited to grow as a photographer by exploring portrait photography.
      I’m eager to connect with people and tell their stories through light, composition, and emotion.
      No matter the subject, my goal is always the same: to capture authenticity and share the beauty
      I see with the world.
