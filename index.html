  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Wilson, a passionate photographer with over 10 years of experience behind the lens. 
    My love for photography began with a deep appreciation for the natural world, and to this day, 
    I spend most of my time capturing breathtaking landscapes, wildlife, and serene moments in nature. 
    Whether it’s the quiet beauty of a forest or the subtle movement of animals in their habitat, 
    I strive to preserve the emotion and atmosphere of every scene I witness.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last few years, my interests have expanded to include aviation and automotive photography — 
    fields that combine my love for speed, precision, and engineering. I find joy in capturing the 
    power and elegance of aircraft in flight and the sleek lines of vehicles in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, I'm excited to grow as a photographer by exploring portrait photography. 
    I’m eager to connect with people and tell their stories through light, composition, and emotion. 
    No matter the subject, my goal is always the same: to capture authenticity and share the beauty 
    I see with the world.
